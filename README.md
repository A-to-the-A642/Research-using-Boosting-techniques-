This is a research project I did with my professor as an assistant in research with her, where I helped her find out what is the best boosting technique using R programming in this research. 

the following techniques are as follows:
XGBoost
Gradiant Boost
AdaBoost (otherwise known as Adaptive Boosting)

Hopefully, with this code, you can also try it out and play around with it.
and also hopefully, it will be published on BEEI
